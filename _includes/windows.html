Please go through all the installation steps below and make sure that
you not only installed them, but start them up to make sure they're working.
If you have any problems, don't hesitate to email the instructors to
ask for help, or arrive early on the first day of the workshop to
get help.

  <ol>
<li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
<br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have
Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set!
<br>
If you need a spreadsheet
program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install
instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.
       <ul>
          <li><b>Download the Installer</b>
        <br>Install LibreOffice by going to the <a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/>installation page</a>. The version for Windows
should automatically be selected. Click on the button below "Main Installer" <b>Download Version x.y.z</b>. You
will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't need to make one.
Your download should begin automatically.
          <li><b>Install LibreOffice</b>
            <br>Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and it should install.
<li>To use LibreOffice, double click on the icon and it will open.
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>OpenRefine</b>
<br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning
that runs through a web browser, and any browser -
Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer - should work fine.
You will need to download OpenRefine and install it,
and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need
an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
<ul>
<li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download
page</a>
<li>Click on <i>Windows kit</i> to download the install file
<li>To use it, unzip, and double-click on openrefine.exe (if you're having issues
with openrefine.exe try refine.bat instead)
<li>OpenRefine will then open in your web browser.
<li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should see OpenRefine.
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>Python & Jupyter notebooks</b>
<br>In the workshop, we will be using Jupyter notebooks to access the Python environment. You can install both Python and Jupyter notebooks from a single install.</br>
<ul>
<li>      Follow the Anaconda link <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">here</a>to the Anaconda website. There are versions of Anaconda available for Windows, macOS and Linux. The web site will detect your operating system and provide a link to the appropriate download.
<li> There will be two options, one for Python 2.x and another for Python 3.x. We will take the Python 3.x option.   
<li> For Windows and Linux there is the option of either a 64 bit (default) download or a 32bit download. Unless you know that you do not have an old 32bit pc you should choose the 64bit installer.   
<li>Run the downloaded installer program. Accept the default settings until you are given the option to add Anaconda to your environmental Path variable. Despite the recommendation not to and the subsequent warning, you should select this option. This will make it easier later on to start Jupyter notebooks from any location.
<li>The installation can take a few minutes. When finished you should be able to open a cmd prompt (Type cmd from Windows start) and into the cmd window type 'python'. 
<li> You should get a message sayingwhat version of Python you installed and a '>>>' prompt.
<li> You can close the python session by typing 'quit()'.
<li> You can check Jupyter by typing 'Jupyter notebook'. This will produce a variety of messages, but more importantly, it should load the Jupyter front page in your default browser.
<li> If your browser doesn't open, open it manually and type in 'localhost:8888' as the URL
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>SQLite</b>
<br>
For this workshop we're going to use the free application DB Browser for SQLite
<ul>
<li>The software can be downloaded from the <a href=http://sqlitebrowser.org/>DB Browser site</a>
<li>Select the latest Windows version and download the single installer file.
<li>Execute the downloaded file by double clicking it.
<li>You will require admin permissions to perform the install.  
<li>Accept all of the default options in the installation wizard.
<li>The installation does not create a desktop icon. You can find/run DB Browser from the Windows search/start button.
</ul>
</ol>
