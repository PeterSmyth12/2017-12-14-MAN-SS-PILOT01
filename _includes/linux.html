Please go through all the installation steps below and make sure that
you not only installed them, but start them up to make sure they're working.
If you have any problems, don't hesitate to email the instructors to
ask for help, or arrive early on the first day of the workshop to
get help.

  <ol>
    <li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
      <br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. LibreOffice comes
      preinstalled with several Linux distributions. If you don't already have it, use
      your package manager to install it: (e.g., <code>sudo apt-get install
	libreoffice</code> for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions).
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>OpenRefine</b>
  <br>OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning that runs
  through a web browser, and any browser - Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer -
  should work fine.  You will need to download Google Refine and install it, and
  when you open it, it will run through the browser, but you don't need an
  internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the OpenRefine <a href="http://openrefine.org/download.html">download
	page</a>
    <li>Click on <i>Linux kit</i> to download the install file
    <li>Download and extract
    <li>Type <code>./refine</code> in your terminal and Google Refine will then
    open in your web browser.
    <li>If it doesn't open automatically, open a web broswer after you've started
      the program and go to the URL <code>http://localhost:3333</code> and you should
      see OpenRefine.
  </ul>

<p>

  <li><b>Python & Jupyter notebooks</b>
<br>In the workshop, we will be using Jupyter notebooks to access the Python environment. You can install both Python and Jupyter notebooks from a single install.</br>
<ul>
<li>      Follow the Anaconda link <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">here</a>to the Anaconda website. There are versions of Anaconda available for Windows, macOS and Linux. The web site will detect your operating system and provide a link to the appropriate download.
<li> There will be two options, one for Python 2.x and another for Python 3.x. We will take the Python 3.x option.   
<li> For Windows and Linux there is the option of either a 64 bit (default) download or a 32bit download. Unless you know that you do not have an old 32bit pc you should choose the 64bit installer.   
<li>Run the downloaded installer program. Accept the default settings until you are given the option to add Anaconda to your environmental Path variable. Despite the recommendation not to and the subsequent warning, you should select this option. This will make it easier later on to start Jupyter notebooks from any location.
<li>The installation can take a few minutes. When finished you should be able to open a terminal window and 'python'. 
<li> You should get a message saying what version of Python you installed and a '>>>' prompt.
<li> You can close the python session by typing 'quit()'.
<li> You can check Jupyter by typing 'jupyter notebook'. This will produce a variety of messages, but more importantly, it should load the Jupyter front page in your default browser.
<li> If your browser doesn't open, open it manually and type in 'localhost:8888' as the URL
</ul>



<p>



<li><b>SQLite</b>
<br>
For this workshop we're going to use the free application DB Browser for SQLite
<ul>
<li>The software can be downloaded from the <a href=http://sqlitebrowser.org/>DB Browser site</a>
<li>Instructions for installing DB Browser for various flavours of Linux are given on the page.
</ul>
</ol>
